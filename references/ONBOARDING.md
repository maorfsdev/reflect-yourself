# reflect-yourself — Quick onboarding

- **What it does:** Captures your corrections and session learnings, then syncs them to the right place (project or personal skills, or project rules). You approve what gets applied.
- **When to run `/reflect-yourself`:** At the end of a productive session, after corrections, or when you want to formalize what the agent learned.
- **When to run `/reflect-yourself-skills`:** When you want to discover repeating patterns that could become new skills (e.g. from recent sessions).
- **Where learnings go:** Project-specific → `.cursor/skills/` or `.cursor/rules/`; reusable across projects → `~/.cursor/skills/`. Pending items sit in `~/.cursor/reflect-queue.json` until you process or discard them.
